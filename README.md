# MailFred

## What is MailFred?
MailFred let's you temporarily archive and set reminders for GMail. Mails will come back to your inbox when you need them.
It works in Google Chrome with GMail and Google Apps For Your Domain and looks like this:

**MailFred is in no way affiliated with Google, Inc.**

## Where can I find MailFred?
The source code for our extension is [open](https://github.com/MailFred/extension) in case you want to contribute (which we would really appreciate).

All of the components of the extension are open source as well, for example we use [eventr](https://github.com/joscha/eventr), which is a Javascript event simulator to fire events on the buttons in GMail. We use [GMailr](https://github.com/joscha/gmailr), which is a Javascript API for GMail to find message IDs and whether you are in a conversation or threaded view and [gmailui](https://github.com/joscha/gmailui) to generate buttons and overlays which look exactly like native GMail.

Our [website](http://www.mailfred.de) has more information about our free service and the extension in an installable form can be found here [for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mailfred/lijahkfnlmaikbppnbjeelhihaklhoim).
